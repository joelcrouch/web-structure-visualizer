# Not ready for production yet-still getting the MVP working-should be done in a few days
# Web Scraper Library

## Overview

The `web_scraper` library is a Python package designed to simplify the process of web scraping and data extraction. It allows users to:

1. Scrape a webpage and parse its structure.
2. Identify fields and their unique tags.
3. Visualize webpage fields for easy exploration.
4. Detect repeating elements like articles, product listings, etc.
5. Search for specific values (e.g., dates, titles) within the webpage's content.

This library is particularly useful for anyone who needs to extract structured data from semi-structured HTML pages.

## Features

- **Web Scraping**: Fetch and parse HTML content using popular libraries.
- **Field Identification**: Automatically identify key fields and their structure.
- **Visualization**: Highlight webpage structure and fields in a browser for better understanding.
- **Search**: Locate specific values (e.g., titles, dates) within the document.
- **Pattern Detection**: Identify repeating elements, such as articles or rows in a table.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joelcrouch/web_scraper.git
cd web_scraper
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Features

Web Scraping: Fetch and parse HTML content using popular libraries.
Field Identification: Automatically identify key fields and their structure.
Visualization: Highlight webpage structure and fields in a browser for better understanding.
Search: Locate specific values (e.g., titles, dates) within the document.
Pattern Detection: Identify repeating elements, such as articles or rows in a table.

## USAGE

This is how I imagine it will be used. This is
the first draft stab so things will change.

```
python
from web_scraper.scraper import Scraper
from web_scraper.field_identifier import FieldIdentifier

# Step 1: Initialize the scraper
scraper = Scraper("https://news.ycombinator.com/")

# Step 2: Fetch the webpage content
soup = scraper.fetch()

# Step 3: Identify fields
field_identifier = FieldIdentifier(soup)
fields = field_identifier.get_unique_tags()
print(fields)

# Step 4: Visualize fields (optional)
from web_scraper.visualizer import Visualizer
visualizer = Visualizer(soup)
visualizer.show()


```

## Project Structure

This is the structure, ostensibly. Again a first draft, and some handy comments to remind me what i have to do.
